# Feature Specification: MyRight Platform Functionality Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `003-myright-functionality-fix`  
**Created**: 2025-09-27  
**Status**: Implementation Required  
**Priority**: CRITICAL (Platform currently non-functional)

## Problem Statement

The MyRight platform has been successfully deployed with a complete, professional UI but lacks all core functionality. Users can see the interface but cannot:
- Perform searches (search input doesn't respond)
- Browse categories (buttons don't trigger actions) 
- View content (no scenario data displays)
- Access any legal information (core purpose unfulfilled)

**Current State**: Beautiful UI with zero functionality  
**Required State**: Fully functional legal rights discovery platform

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT functionality must work and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid implementation details (handled in plan/tasks)
- üë• Addresses business-critical functionality gap

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user visits the deployed MyRight platform and can immediately search for legal information using natural language, browse categories to find relevant scenarios, and access detailed legal rights with verified government sources - transforming the current non-functional deployment into a working legal discovery tool.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user types "boss not paying salary" in the search box, **When** they press search, **Then** they see relevant employment scenarios with detailed legal rights and government source links
2. **Given** a user clicks the "Employment" category button, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see a filtered list of employment-related legal scenarios
3. **Given** a user views search results, **When** they click on a scenario, **Then** they see detailed legal information with step-by-step action guides and official source citations
4. **Given** a user searches using natural language, **When** semantic search processes the query, **Then** they receive semantically relevant results even if exact keywords don't match
5. **Given** a user needs legal information, **When** they access any scenario, **Then** they find comprehensive content including rights, legal basis, action steps, and government sources

### Critical Functionality Requirements
- Search input must accept and process text queries
- Category navigation must filter and display relevant scenarios  
- Results must display actual legal content, not placeholder text
- All government source links must be functional and verified
- Semantic search must understand natural language queries
- Mobile interface must work identically to desktop

- **FR-017**: Action steps MUST be presented as numbered, actionable instructions
- **FR-018**: Related scenarios MUST be suggested at bottom of each scenario page
- **FR-019**: Legal disclaimer MUST be visible but not obtrusive on all content pages

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance  
- **NFR-001**: Initial search results MUST appear within 2 seconds
- **NFR-002**: Category filtering MUST be instantaneous (< 500ms)
- **NFR-003**: Page load times MUST be under 3 seconds on 3G connections
- **NFR-004**: Search index MUST support 1000+ concurrent users without performance degradation

#### Usability
- **NFR-005**: Search functionality MUST work identically on mobile and desktop
- **NFR-006**: Platform MUST be usable without any technical knowledge
- **NFR-007**: All functionality MUST work with keyboard navigation for accessibility
- **NFR-008**: Content MUST be readable at standard mobile text sizes

#### Reliability
- **NFR-009**: Core search functionality MUST work offline using cached content
- **NFR-010**: Government source links MUST be validated and updated quarterly
- **NFR-011**: System MUST gracefully handle malformed queries without errors
- **NFR-012**: Failed searches MUST provide helpful suggestions or category guidance

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Immediate Success (Phase 1)
- User can type in search box and see results appear
- Category buttons show relevant filtered scenarios
- At least 5 legal scenarios display complete content
- Basic keyword search returns accurate results
- All functionality works on mobile devices

### Complete Success (Phase 2)  
- Semantic search understands natural language queries
- All 10 MVP scenarios have comprehensive content
- Government source links verified and functional
- Search autocomplete provides helpful suggestions
- Offline functionality works for core features

### Quality Gates
- **Gate 1**: Basic functionality - search and categories work
- **Gate 2**: Content completeness - all scenarios have legal accuracy
- **Gate 3**: User experience - platform usable without instructions
- **Gate 4**: Production readiness - performance and reliability validated

## Risk Analysis

### High Risk
- **Content Accuracy**: Legal information must be 100% accurate to avoid harm
- **Source Validation**: Government links may become invalid over time
- **User Expectations**: Professional UI creates high functionality expectations

### Medium Risk  
- **Search Relevance**: Poor semantic search results reduce platform value
- **Mobile Performance**: Complex content may slow mobile experience
- **Legal Compliance**: Must maintain clear boundaries around legal advice

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement rigorous content review process with legal verification
- Build automated source link validation with manual quarterly reviews
- Start with basic functionality and enhance incrementally
- Include prominent legal disclaimers on all content

## Technical Constraints

### Platform Constraints
- Must work within existing Next.js 15 deployment on Vercel
- Cannot require backend database (static generation preferred)  
- Must maintain existing professional UI design
- Search functionality should work client-side for performance

### Content Constraints
- All legal content must cite official government sources
- Cannot provide personalized legal advice or case-specific guidance
- Must handle content updates through static file regeneration
- Legal disclaimers required on all content pages

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies  
- Existing UI components and design system
- Current deployment pipeline and Vercel configuration
- Established project structure and TypeScript setup

### External Dependencies
- Government source websites for legal citations
- Content verification process for legal accuracy
- Potential legal review for disclaimers and content boundaries

## Clarifications

### Session 1: Content and Functionality Scope (2025-09-27)

**Q**: What is the minimum viable functionality that constitutes "working"?
**A**: Users must be able to search for legal issues and receive relevant legal information with government sources. The core loop is: search ‚Üí results ‚Üí detailed legal rights ‚Üí actionable steps.

**Q**: How should semantic search be implemented given deployment constraints?
**A**: Use client-side similarity matching with pre-computed embeddings for the 10 MVP scenarios. This avoids backend requirements while providing intelligent search.

**Q**: What level of legal accuracy is required for content?  
**A**: All legal claims must be backed by official government sources with working links. Content should be reviewed for accuracy but doesn't require lawyer approval for information (not advice).

**Q**: Should the platform work completely offline?
**A**: Core search and content viewing should work offline using PWA caching. Source link verification requires internet but shouldn't block core functionality.

**Q**: How do we handle the transition from non-functional to functional without breaking the UI?
**A**: Implement functionality incrementally, testing each component before integration. The existing UI is solid and should be preserved while adding backend logic.
