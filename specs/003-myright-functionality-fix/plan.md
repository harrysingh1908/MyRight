# Implementation Plan: MyRight Platform Functionality Implementation

**Branch**: `003-myright-functionality-fix` | **Date**: 2025-09-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-myright-functionality-fix/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → ✅ Feature spec loaded successfully
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Project Type: Web application (Next.js frontend with client-side functionality)
   → Structure Decision: Existing project enhancement (no new structure needed)
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → No violations detected: Enhancing existing platform functionality
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check ✅
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → No NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain after context analysis
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section

```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands.

## Summary

**Primary Requirement**: Transform the deployed MyRight platform from a non-functional UI showcase into a fully working legal rights discovery system where users can search for legal scenarios and access detailed legal information with government sources.

**Technical Approach**: Enhance the existing Next.js application by implementing client-side search functionality, populating comprehensive legal scenario data, building semantic search with pre-computed embeddings, and connecting all UI components to functional backend logic - all while maintaining the existing professional interface and deployment infrastructure.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+ with Next.js 15, React 18+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, existing search/content services  
**Storage**: Static JSON files for legal scenarios, client-side caching for embeddings  
**Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library (existing test suite to be enhanced)  
**Target Platform**: Web (Vercel deployment), Progressive Web App capabilities  
**Project Type**: Web application enhancement (existing frontend with functional gaps)  
**Performance Goals**: <2s search results, <500ms category filtering, <3s mobile load times  
**Constraints**: Client-side only (no backend), static generation preferred, maintain existing UI  
**Scale/Scope**: 10 MVP legal scenarios, 1000+ concurrent users, semantic search capability

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### I. ACCESSIBILITY FIRST ✅
- **Compliance**: Enhancing existing mobile-optimized UI with functional search
- **Implementation**: Search functionality will work identically on mobile/desktop
- **Plain Language**: All legal content includes simple explanations alongside citations

### II. SOURCE CREDIBILITY (NON-NEGOTIABLE) ✅  
- **Compliance**: All 10 legal scenarios will include verified government source links
- **Implementation**: Quarterly automated link validation, manual content review process
- **Verification**: Each legal right backed by official government sources with working URLs

### III. SITUATION-BASED APPROACH ✅
- **Compliance**: Search and categories organized around real situations, not legal theory
- **Implementation**: Scenarios like "boss not paying salary" vs "employment law violations"
- **Navigation**: Category structure matches user problems (Employment, Consumer, etc.)

### IV. NO LEGAL ADVICE BOUNDARY ✅
- **Compliance**: Platform provides information only, never personalized advice
- **Implementation**: Legal disclaimers on all content, clear "information not advice" messaging
- **Boundaries**: Step-by-step guides for general situations, not case-specific recommendations

### V. INCLUSIVE DESIGN ✅
- **Compliance**: Functionality works on basic smartphones, offline capability for core features
- **Implementation**: Progressive Web App caching, semantic search with keyboard navigation
- **Accessibility**: Existing UI meets WCAG 2.1 AA, search functionality will maintain standards

**Gate Status**: All constitutional principles satisfied. No violations or deviations.

**Structure Decision**: Enhance existing Next.js web application structure (no new structure needed)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

**Research completed through context analysis - no NEEDS CLARIFICATION items remain.**

### Key Research Findings:

**Decision**: Use client-side semantic search with pre-computed embeddings  
**Rationale**: Avoids backend complexity, works with static deployment, maintains fast performance  
**Alternatives considered**: Server-side search API (requires backend), third-party search service (adds dependency)

**Decision**: JSON file-based content storage with structured scenario format  
**Rationale**: Easy to update, version control friendly, works with static generation  
**Alternatives considered**: CMS integration (overkill), database (requires backend)

**Decision**: Enhance existing service layer rather than rebuild  
**Rationale**: Existing TypeScript interfaces and component structure are solid  
**Alternatives considered**: Complete rewrite (unnecessary), external search library (adds complexity)

**Output**: ✅ research.md complete (findings documented above)

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Model Design
**Entities identified from feature spec**:
- **LegalScenario**: Core content entity with rights, actions, sources
- **SearchResult**: Search response with confidence scoring
- **EmbeddingVector**: Semantic search representations  
- **Category**: Navigation and filtering structure
- **LegalRight**: Individual rights within scenarios
- **ActionStep**: User guidance within scenarios

### API Contracts
**Core service interfaces**:
- SearchService.search(): Natural language query → ranked results
- SearchService.autocomplete(): Partial query → suggestions
- ContentService.getScenario(): Scenario ID → detailed content
- ContentService.getByCategory(): Category → filtered scenarios

### Contract Tests
**Test scenarios from user stories**:
- Search "boss not paying salary" → employment scenarios
- Click Employment category → filtered employment scenarios  
- View scenario detail → complete legal information with sources
- Semantic search "fired without notice" → wrongful termination match

### Integration Tests
**Key user flow validations**:
- End-to-end search functionality
- Category filtering with content display
- Scenario detail page rendering
- Mobile search interface

**Output**: ✅ Phase 1 design artifacts ready for generation

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs and existing code analysis
- Prioritize core functionality: search state → content data → semantic matching
- Each service method → contract test task [P]
- Each content category → data creation task [P]
- UI connection tasks to wire functional backend to existing components
- Semantic search implementation as integrated system

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **Priority 1**: Basic search functionality (input handling, keyword search, results display)
- **Priority 2**: Content data system (10 MVP scenarios with legal accuracy)
- **Priority 3**: Semantic search layer (embeddings, similarity matching)
- **Priority 4**: Enhancement and optimization (autocomplete, performance, offline)

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered tasks focusing on critical functionality implementation

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, validate search functionality, verify legal content accuracy)

## Complexity Tracking
*No Constitution Check violations detected - no entries needed*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
