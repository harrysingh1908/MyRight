# Research: MyRight Platform Functionality Implementation

**Date**: 2025-09-27  
**Feature**: MyRight Platform Functionality Implementation  
**Context**: Transform non-functional deployed platform into working legal rights discovery system

## Research Overview

This research focuses on implementing core functionality for the existing MyRight platform, which currently has a complete UI but no working backend logic. The goal is to enable search, content discovery, and legal information access while maintaining the existing professional interface.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Assets ✅
- **Next.js 15 Application**: Complete deployment on Vercel with professional UI
- **Component Structure**: SearchInterface, SearchResults, CategoryNavigation, ScenarioDetail all exist
- **Service Layer**: SearchService and ContentService TypeScript classes defined
- **Type System**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- **Test Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library setup with 84/84 passing contract tests

### Missing Functionality ❌
- **Search State Management**: Search input doesn't update component state
- **Content Data**: Only 1 of 10 required legal scenarios has content
- **Service Implementation**: SearchService and ContentService are interface stubs
- **Semantic Search**: No embedding system or similarity matching
- **Category Filtering**: Category buttons don't trigger any functionality

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Search Implementation Strategy

**Decision**: Client-side semantic search with pre-computed embeddings  
**Rationale**: 
- Maintains existing static deployment model (no backend required)
- Provides fast response times for 10 scenario MVP scope  
- Enables offline functionality through service worker caching
- Scales to 1000+ concurrent users without server costs

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Server-side API with vector database: Requires backend infrastructure, increases complexity
- Third-party search service: Adds external dependency, ongoing costs
- Simple keyword matching only: Inadequate for natural language queries like "boss fired me"

**Implementation Approach**:
- Generate sentence-transformer embeddings for all scenario variations offline
- Store embeddings as static JSON files alongside scenario content
- Implement cosine similarity matching in SearchService
- Fall back to keyword search for queries below similarity threshold

### 2. Content Data Architecture  

**Decision**: Structured JSON files with comprehensive legal scenario format  
**Rationale**:
- Easy to update and version control legal content
- Supports static site generation for optimal performance  
- Enables content validation and legal review workflows
- Compatible with existing TypeScript type system

**Content Structure**:
```json
{
  "id": "scenario-identifier", 
  "title": "User-facing scenario title",
  "description": "Plain language scenario summary",
  "category": "employment|consumer|housing|police|family|digital",
  "rights": [
    {
      "id": "right-identifier",
      "title": "Legal right title", 
      "description": "Plain language explanation",
      "legalBasis": {
        "law": "Act name",
        "section": "Section number", 
        "url": "Official government source"
      },
      "actionSteps": ["Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3"]
    }
  ],
  "searchTerms": ["natural", "language", "variations"],
  "relatedScenarios": ["other-scenario-ids"]
}
```

**Quality Assurance Process**:
- Each legal claim backed by verifiable government source
- Quarterly review of all source URLs for validity
- Plain language explanations for all legal terms
- Legal disclaimer integration without deterring users

### 3. Service Layer Enhancement

**Decision**: Enhance existing SearchService and ContentService classes  
**Rationale**:
- Existing TypeScript interfaces are well-designed and comprehensive
- Component integration points already established
- Maintains existing test structure and expectations
- Avoids breaking changes to UI components

**SearchService Implementation**:
- `search(query, filters)`: Natural language search with semantic matching
- `autocomplete(partial)`: Real-time suggestions based on available scenarios  
- `getSuggestions()`: Popular searches and category guidance
- Confidence scoring for semantic matches (0-100%)
- Fallback to keyword search for low-confidence semantic matches

**ContentService Implementation**:  
- `getScenario(id)`: Full scenario details with rights and action steps
- `getByCategory(category)`: Filtered scenarios for category navigation
- `getAllScenarios()`: Complete scenario index for search processing
- `validateSources()`: Automated government source link checking

### 4. Component Integration Strategy

**Decision**: Wire existing UI components to functional services with minimal changes  
**Rationale**:
- Existing components are well-structured and professionally designed
- Integration points clearly defined in component props
- Maintains visual consistency and user experience
- Reduces risk of breaking existing functionality

**Integration Points**:
- SearchInterface: Connect onSearch prop to SearchService.search()
- CategoryNavigation: Connect onCategorySelect to ContentService.getByCategory()  
- SearchResults: Connect results prop to SearchService response format
- ScenarioDetail: Connect scenario prop to ContentService.getScenario()

### 5. Performance Optimization

**Decision**: Progressive Web App caching with strategic preloading  
**Rationale**:
- Enables offline functionality for core legal scenarios
- Reduces load times for returning users
- Supports low-bandwidth mobile users  
- Maintains fast search response times

**Caching Strategy**:
- Preload all scenario content and embeddings on first visit
- Cache search results for common queries
- Service worker for offline scenario access
- Lazy load detailed legal citations to improve initial load

## Legal Content Research

### Government Source Validation

**Primary Sources Identified**:
- Ministry of Labour and Employment: https://labour.gov.in/
