# Feature Specification: MyRight Legal Rights Discovery Platform (Updated)

**Feature Branch**: `001-myright-legal-rights`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Updated**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Risk-Mitigated Draft  
**Input**: User description: "MyRight - a legal rights discovery platform for Indian citizens with risk mitigation strategies"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An Indian citizen faces a legal situation and needs to quickly understand their rights and next steps. They visit MyRight, use intelligent semantic search or browse categories, find relevant legal information with verified government citations, and get actionable step-by-step guidance - all within 60 seconds without needing legal expertise. They trust the information because every claim is backed by visible government sources.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has unpaid salary for 2 months, **When** they search "boss not paying salary", **Then** they find relevant Labor Code 2020 rights with clickable government sources, step-by-step complaint process, and confidence score indicating 95%+ match accuracy
2. **Given** a user types "company fired me without notice", **When** semantic search processes the query, **Then** they find "wrongful termination" scenario with plain language explanation + Labor Code citation + official source link
3. **Given** a user searches "police asking for money", **When** results appear, **Then** they see anti-corruption rights with Prevention of Corruption Act citations, complaint procedures, and official helpline numbers
4. **Given** a user on mobile with poor internet, **When** they visit previously viewed scenarios, **Then** core content loads from PWA cache for offline browsing
5. **Given** a user wants to verify a legal claim, **When** they click any citation, **Then** they go directly to the official government source document
6. **Given** a user searches for an uncovered scenario, **When** no good match exists, **Then** they see "We don't cover this yet" with suggestion form

### Edge Cases
- What happens when semantic search confidence is <70%? ‚Üí Show "We don't cover this yet" + suggestion form + related categories
- How does system handle very broad queries like "help"? ‚Üí Guide user to category selection or suggest specific situation examples  
- What happens when official source links become unavailable? ‚Üí Display warning, provide cached version, escalate for manual review
- How does system handle mixed Hindi/English searches? ‚Üí Process with language detection, show English limitation notice if needed
- What happens when user situation doesn't fit 10 MVP scenarios? ‚Üí Clear message + suggestion form for future scenarios
- How do we ensure state law variations don't confuse users? ‚Üí Explicit focus on central/federal laws with clear disclaimers
- What if semantic matching fails completely? ‚Üí Fallback to keyword search, then category browsing guidance
- How do we handle outdated government sources? ‚Üí Automated daily link checking + quarterly manual content review
