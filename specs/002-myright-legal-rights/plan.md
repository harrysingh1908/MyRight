**Branch**: `002-myright-legal-rights` | **Date**: 2025-09-26 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/harry/MyRight/specs/002-myright-legal-rights/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   â†’ If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   â†’ Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   â†’ Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   â†’ If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   â†’ If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   â†’ Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 â†’ research.md
   â†’ If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 â†’ contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   â†’ If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   â†’ Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 â†’ Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 9. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md  
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

**STATUS**: âœ… PLAN EXECUTION COMPLETE - Ready for /tasks command

## Summary
MyRight is a legal rights discovery platform enabling Indian citizens to quickly find relevant legal information through intelligent semantic search. Users can search using natural language ("boss not paying salary") and get matched to appropriate scenarios with verified government sources, legal citations, and actionable steps. The platform focuses on 10 priority legal scenarios with PWA architecture for offline access and professional UI quality matching established legal services.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript/JavaScript with Node.js 18+, React 18+ with Next.js 14+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js (static generation), sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2), React, Tailwind CSS for styling  
**Storage**: Static JSON files for content, pre-computed embeddings, no database required  
**Testing**: Jest for unit testing, Playwright for E2E testing, manual user testing for search accuracy  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (mobile-first responsive), deployed as static site with PWA capabilities
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend-focused with static generation)  
**Performance Goals**: <3 second page load on 3G, <200ms search response time, 80%+ search accuracy  
**Constraints**: Client-side processing only, offline capability required, no personal data storage, 100% government source verification  
**Scale/Scope**: 10-20 initial users for MVP validation, 10 legal scenarios, semantic search with 10-15 variations per scenario

## Progress Tracking

### Constitution Check Status
- âœ… **Initial Constitution Check**: All principles addressed in technical approach
- ðŸ”„ **Post-Design Constitution Check**: Validated through contract specifications
- âœ… **Source Credibility**: Government source verification system designed
- âœ… **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance planned in UI contracts
- âœ… **Situation-Based**: Semantic search enables natural language queries
- âœ… **Legal Boundary**: Clear disclaimers and information-only approach
- âœ… **Inclusive Design**: Mobile-first, professional quality standards

### Complexity Tracking
**Justified Complexity**:
- **Semantic Search**: Required for constitutional "situation-based approach" - users must find rights through natural language, not legal categories
- **Source Verification**: Required for constitutional "source credibility" - every legal claim must be verifiable
- **Professional UI**: Required for constitutional "inclusive design" - platform must serve all citizens effectively

**Complexity Mitigation**:
- Client-side processing eliminates server infrastructure
- Pre-computed embeddings avoid runtime ML complexity  
- Static site generation ensures performance and reliability
- Proven libraries (Next.js, sentence-transformers) reduce custom development

### Risk Mitigation Status
- âœ… **Legal Liability**: Comprehensive disclaimer strategy and content review process
- âœ… **Search Effectiveness**: Semantic search with 80%+ accuracy targets and fallback strategies
- âœ… **Technical Complexity**: Simplified to client-side processing with proven technologies
- âœ… **Content Quality**: Structured verification pipeline with automated and manual checks

**Ready for /tasks command execution** âœ…

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile app]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION â†’ research task
   - For each dependency â†’ best practices task
   - For each integration â†’ patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** â†’ `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action â†’ endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story â†’ integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract â†’ contract test task [P]
- Each entity â†’ model creation task [P] 
- Each user story â†’ integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
