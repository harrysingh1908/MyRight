# MyRight Platform: Risk Analysis & Implementation Clarifications

**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Critical Issues Identified  
**Purpose**: De-risk project before planning phase

## ðŸš¨ HIGHEST PRIORITY RISKS (Must Resolve Before Planning)

### **RISK #1: Content Accuracy & Legal Liability (CRITICAL)**
**Impact**: Legal liability, user harm, platform credibility failure  
**Probability**: HIGH without proper safeguards

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
- No defined process for validating AI-generated content variations maintain legal accuracy
- Unclear how to handle state-specific law variations (employment laws vary significantly between Karnataka, Maharashtra, etc.)
- Missing strategy for handling outdated government website information
- No clear legal disclaimer framework to protect against liability

**Immediate Resolution Required:**
1. **Legal Review Process**: Every AI-generated scenario variation MUST be reviewed by qualified legal professionals before publication
2. **State Law Handling**: Either (a) limit to central/federal laws only, or (b) explicitly note state variations with sources
3. **Source Staleness Detection**: Implement automated checking of government links + manual review schedule
4. **Liability Framework**: Engage legal counsel to draft comprehensive disclaimers and platform terms

### **RISK #2: Dataset Quality & Search Effectiveness (HIGH)**
**Impact**: Poor user experience, failed 60-second discovery goal  
**Probability**: HIGH without systematic approach

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
- No methodology for generating 10-20 natural language variations per scenario
- Missing validation that AI variations actually match how real users describe problems
- Unclear minimum dataset size for meaningful semantic search results
- No fallback strategy for scenarios not covered in initial 30

**Immediate Resolution Required:**
1. **User Language Research**: Conduct interviews/surveys with 50+ Indians about how they describe legal problems
2. **Variation Generation Pipeline**: 
   - Start with real user descriptions collected from legal aid organizations
   - Generate variations using LLM, validate against user research
   - Test with target demographic before finalizing
3. **Search Effectiveness Threshold**: Define minimum 70% accuracy for top result relevance
4. **Fallback Strategy**: "We don't cover this situation yet" + form to suggest new scenarios

### **RISK #3: Technical Architecture Complexity (MEDIUM-HIGH)**
**Impact**: Performance issues, implementation delays, scaling problems  
**Probability**: MEDIUM with current approach

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
- Hybrid search (static + semantic) adds complexity without clear performance benefit
- Embedding generation/storage strategy undefined
- Unclear how semantic search works with only 5-10 scenarios in MVP
- Missing multilingual handling strategy

**Immediate Resolution Required:**
1. **Simplify MVP Architecture**: Start with keyword-only search, add semantic layer in Phase 2
2. **Embedding Strategy**: Use pre-computed sentence embeddings (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2), store as JSON
3. **MVP Search Approach**: Focus on exact keyword matching + synonyms for initial 5-10 scenarios
4. **Language Strategy**: English-only MVP with clear limitation notice

## ðŸ“‹ SPECIFICATION GAPS REQUIRING CLARIFICATION

### **Dataset Creation Strategy**

**Missing Critical Details:**
- **Content Verification Pipeline**: How do we ensure every piece of information has verifiable government source?
  - **Proposed Solution**: 3-step verification: (1) Original government source, (2) Legal professional review, (3) Regular link/content staleness checks
- **Scenario Prioritization**: Which 5-10 scenarios for MVP based on user impact vs implementation complexity?
  - **Proposed Solution**: Priority = (User frequency Ã— Legal urgency Ã— Source availability) / Implementation complexity
- **Natural Language Variations**: How do we generate variations that match real user language?
  - **Proposed Solution**: Start with legal aid organization case logs + user research interviews

### **Technical Implementation Risks**

**Architecture Decision Points:**
- **Search Performance**: Can client-side search handle 30 scenarios effectively?
  - **Risk Mitigation**: Benchmark with 100+ test scenarios, optimize for mobile performance
- **Embedding Model**: Which specific model for semantic similarity?
  - **Recommendation**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (lightweight, good performance, runs client-side)
- **Content Updates**: How to handle government website changes without full rebuild?
  - **Proposed Solution**: Automated daily link checking + quarterly content review process

### **Content Accuracy & Legal Protection**

**Legal Safeguards Needed:**
- **State Law Variations**: How to handle Employment Act differences between states?
  - **MVP Solution**: Focus on central laws only (Labor Code 2020, Consumer Protection Act 2019)
- **Content Staleness**: Government websites change - how to maintain accuracy?
  - **Solution**: Automated monitoring + manual quarterly review + user reporting system
- **AI Content Validation**: How to ensure AI doesn't misrepresent legal situations?
  - **Solution**: No AI-generated legal content without human legal professional review

### **Scope & Feasibility Assessment**

**MVP Realism Check:**
- **5-10 Scenarios Sufficient?**: Can this demonstrate full platform capability?
  - **Analysis**: YES, if scenarios cover different search patterns and content complexity
- **Professional Appearance**: What specific design standards prevent "college project" look?
  - **Benchmarks**: Match visual quality of Vakilsearch.com, LegalKart design standards
- **60-Second Discovery**: Realistic with limited content?
  - **Validation Strategy**: User testing with 20+ participants per scenario

## âœ… RECOMMENDED DE-RISKING APPROACH

### **Phase 0: Foundation (Before Planning)**
1. **Legal Framework Setup** (2 weeks)
   - Engage legal counsel for disclaimer framework
   - Define content verification process
   - Establish state vs central law handling policy

2. **User Research** (1 week)
   - Interview 20+ users about legal problem descriptions
   - Analyze legal aid organization case logs
   - Define natural language variation patterns

3. **Technical Architecture Simplification** (1 week)
   - Commit to keyword-only search for MVP
   - Define embedding strategy for Phase 2
   - Establish performance benchmarks

### **Phase 1: MVP Content Creation**
**Prioritized Scenarios (Impact Ã— Urgency Ã— Source Availability):**
1. **Unpaid Salary** - High impact, clear central law (Labor Code 2020)
2. **Security Deposit Disputes** - Very common, clear procedures
3. **Police Bribery** - High urgency, clear anti-corruption framework
4. **Defective Products** - Clear Consumer Protection Act coverage
5. **Workplace Harassment** - Recent legal updates, high social impact

### **Success Criteria Definition**
- **Search Accuracy**: 70%+ users find relevant scenario in first 3 results
- **Load Performance**: <3 seconds on 3G mobile connection
- **Source Verification**: 100% of legal claims have clickable government sources
- **User Completion**: 60%+ complete entire scenario reading + action steps
- **Professional Quality**: Score 4.0+ on design professionalism survey vs competitor sites

## ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Before proceeding to planning phase, MUST resolve:**

1. **Legal Review Process** - Define how every piece of content gets validated
2. **MVP Scenario Selection** - Commit to specific 5 scenarios with clear criteria  
3. **Search Architecture** - Simplify to keyword-only for MVP, semantic in Phase 2
4. **Content Source Strategy** - Define exact government sources and verification process
5. **User Language Research** - Understand how target users actually describe legal problems

**Recommended next step:** Address these 5 critical areas before running `/plan` command to ensure implementation plan is built on solid foundation.
